# Async execution: foundation and decisions

[Roadmap](language-revision.md#milestone-5--async-reference-semantics) ·
[Fault boundaries](faults-and-activations.md) ·
[Current feature status](reference/support-status.md)

1 November 2026. This is an E1 design and implementation plan. Compilers 0.98–0.99 add
shared activation identity allocation and persistent reference continuations,
prerequisites for overlapping execution contexts. They do **not** implement source
tasks, source suspension, scheduling or async I/O. Proposed execution rules below
are not new executable syntax.

## Existing direction

The roadmap already separates completed outcomes from pending computations:

- `capture` invokes immediately and stores an ordinary completed outcome.
- Planned `defer` evaluates and transfers arguments now, without running the body.
- Planned `await` consumes a task handle, drives a cold task or waits for an already
  running task, and exposes only its declared normal outcomes.
- Planned `spawn` explicitly schedules child work. A child belongs to an owning
  scope; every path settles or explicitly transfers ownership. There is no hidden
  detach or parallelism caused by an ordinary call.
- Suspension preserves captured loans. Waiting does not end an exclusive borrow.
  Owner storage must remain valid until all dependent tasks and results release it.
- Cancellation is a request followed by a checked completion protocol. It is not a
  source fault, hidden exception, forced frame destruction or guarantee of progress.

The first executor is cooperative and single-threaded, with deterministic modeled
readiness. Native coroutine lowering remains a separate E2 checkpoint. Thread
transfer, synchronization traits and general annotation flags are not introduced.

## What the current runtime does

Before 0.99, the reference interpreter invoked controls recursively through
`Machine::invoke` and traversed loop/boundary instruction lists through `execute`.
Local decisions, instruction positions and return handling lived in Rust stack
frames. Retaining only the values map was insufficient to pause execution.

In 0.99, [explicit continuations](../src/runtime/continuation.rs) hold invocation
returns, decision delivery, loop restarts, and named/lexical work and contingency
transitions. Caller facts and storage bases survive nested calls. Borrowed values
continue to address the same live storage. Normal return and fault unwinding retire
the same slots as before; completed loop iterations do not accumulate continuations.

The [host stepping API](reference/execution-failures.md#stepping-a-reference-execution)
can pause before a checked instruction, retain its execution state, and resume later.
A zero quota does nothing; terminal results are delivered once and cannot resume.
Quota is independent of fixed fuel, whose exhaustion remains terminal. Ordinary
`run` APIs drive the same engine to completion. This is a scripted reference
simulation mechanism, not source `await`, cancellation or an I/O readiness scheduler.

Reference values already use invocation-specific logical slot ranges. A reference
identifies storage and projections rather than a Rust vector element pointer.
The [native generator](../src/native.rs) uses dense activation-local offsets, but its
ordinary function calls and arena retirement still rely on sequential execution.
The reference continuations now persist between host calls. Native frames still need
a separate suspension and retirement protocol; they are not LLVM coroutine frames.

The [fault tracker](../src/fault.rs) records one active chain and bounded causes.
Child trackers isolate a named/lexical boundary's diagnostics; they are not tasks,
task scopes, or scheduling decisions. Before 0.98, `child()` copied the last ID and
`absorb()` merged the maximum after the child returned. Two children created before
either finished would allocate duplicate invocation IDs.

In 0.98, all related trackers share one execution-local monotonic allocator. They
retain separate active chains, source sites, failure flags and causes. Allocation
exhaustion fails without wrapping or partially entering a control. Separate entry
executions still start from ID 1; completed calls do not accumulate a history.
Existing sequential reference/native report IDs retain their order.

The counter orders identity allocation only. Its atomic implementation does not
make Tellur programs concurrent, publish their memory effects, prescribe scheduling,
introduce a task ID, or define spawn/await ancestry. A frozen failed tracker cannot
resume, even if another tracker in that identity family can still allocate IDs.
The executor decides which execution contexts may run.

## Separate the identities and continuations

| Entity | Purpose | Must not be confused with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition/site | Authored control, delta and source provenance | One runtime invocation |
| Activation | One invocation with owned state and local decisions | A loop iteration or allocation address |
| Frame storage | Locations retaining values and loans | An observed diagnostic ID |
| Task handle | Owned pending computation and result obligation | A completed outcome or copyable scheduler token |
| Owning scope | Responsibility for settling children | Whichever control happens to await a handle |
| Fault boundary | Emergency settlement and permitted recovery target | An ordinary outcome consumer |
| Resume point | Explicit checked continuation after suspension | A retained Rust call stack |

A future suspended frame needs its current instruction/structured continuation,
local slots and selected facts, return-delivery target, live children, owner scope,
loan/retention requirements and fault domain. A stored outcome needs none of that
execution machinery. Task completion cannot be represented merely by stuffing a
fault into an outcome payload.

## Pending decision: unhandled spawned-child faults

A question is open with the language author. **Neither option is implemented or
accepted by this document.** The decision concerns a fault escaping a child's own
boundaries; an inner boundary that already settles the fault remains isolated.

| Choice | Observable consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Recommended: fault the owning boundary promptly | At the next cooperative scheduler safe point, its ordinary parent/sibling continuations stop. Resource settlement must finish before contingency or supervised recovery. The fault does not wait for an `await`. |
| Alternative: propagate when awaited | The child's fault stays in a separate pending fault channel until observation; ordinary owner work can continue meanwhile. Unobserved failure at scope exit and the boundary that owns eventual propagation need further rules. |

The recommendation fits the existing rule that ordinary execution does not continue
inside a failed boundary. It also avoids making the placement of `await` a way to
redirect emergency control flow. It requires admission checks for everything the
boundary could abandon, including resources currently held by siblings.

Neither choice permits a fault to become `failed`, `cancelled`, a boolean, or any
other normal outcome. Nor does stopping siblings assert that their fallible cleanup
succeeded. Fault disposition and cooperative cancellation must remain distinct.
A request boundary can send its emergency response only after child loans end and
retained response capabilities are safe to hand over.

The owner-scope relationship, moving handles across fault boundaries, deterministic
selection of multiple escaping faults, and secondary settlement failures must be
specified before general `spawn`. An atomic ID allocator makes no choice here.

## Cold-task contract audit

The next E1c slice must distinguish creating a computation from invoking it. This
is an implementation audit, not newly accepted syntax or executable behavior.

| Operation | Existing direction and required checking |
| --- | --- |
| `defer operation(arguments)` | Evaluate arguments in written order and transfer ownership now. Retain captured loans now. Callee body effects, decisions and faults have not happened; argument construction can still fault immediately. |
| Store or move a cold handle | Preserve the pending computation and all captured owners/loans. A handle is not Copy or a completed outcome. Its eventual result contract alone does not describe everything it owns. |
| `await pending` | Consume the handle once; drive cold work and retain caller/child frames until actual completion. Transfer declared normal payloads and their origins; keep faults outside that result. |
| Fault before the task starts | Check the live captured owners' fault dispositions and retire their borrowers before boundary handover. Discarding a computation cannot claim its external resource protocols completed. |
| Public or generic task types | Describe captured state as well as possible result payloads; `task<result>` alone must not erase loan, completion or fault-disposition requirements. Bound the first source profile if those contracts are unavailable. |
| Entry and suspension | Keep the planned `async control` permission and explicit runtime boundary for a synchronous entry. Host instruction quotas are not source suspension points. |

Ordinary borrowed rvalue calls currently allocate anonymous storage for one
invocation. Deferred arguments would need that storage to travel with the task
instead; extending temporary lifetime incidentally through an implementation pointer
is unsound. A named owner or an explicit checked task-owned backing allocation is
required before enabling that case. Existing grouped/contained origin contracts must
survive capture and delivery, not collapse to the return contract's outer type.

### Pending decision: discarding never-started tasks

A separate question is open with the author: must even a never-started task be
awaited or transferred, or may explicit `drop(pending)` discard it when every captured
value is droppable? The initial recommendation is an await/transfer obligation, in
line with mandatory handling of completed outcomes. **Neither choice is implemented
or accepted here.** This question does not permit cancellation by dropping running
work, and does not change the existing prohibition on hidden detach.

Do not infer the answer from `ExecutionSession` being droppable in the host API:
that object is a scripted simulation, with an explicitly different contract.
While the question is pending, source task disposal and task capability derivation
must remain unimplemented. Independent diagnostic work can continue alongside E1.

## Implementation sequence

| Checkpoint | Deliverable and evidence | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E1a | Runtime audit and shared activation identity allocator; interleaved children, independent failure state, no reuse after return, overflow, and sequential reference/native report parity | Independent of the pending child-fault choice; delivered in 0.98 |
| E1b | Persistent reference continuations and explicit step/resume protocol; current synchronous outcomes, fuel, effects, faults, loans and expansion observations preserved under different step partitions | Delivered in 0.99; independent of the pending child-fault policy; no source async claim |
| E1c | Bounded cold tasks and consuming await; eager argument transfer, no body effects before drive, fixed result contracts, task ownership and retained borrows | Settle source runtime entry/suspension effect contracts and disposal rules before enabling syntax |
| E1d | Scoped spawn and deterministic readiness; two overlapping children, duplicate/stale wake handling and owner settlement | Resolve the pending fault propagation/ownership decision and keep sibling dispositions explicit |
| E1e | Explicit cooperative cancellation and suspending cleanup; normal completion races, cleanup failures and no abandoned losers | Define cancellation observation and cleanup admission; no implicit cancellation exception |
| E2 | Pinned native coroutine experiment, then checked lowering and schedule-based differential validation | Reference semantics and legal frame retirement must precede native destruction |

These are completion boundaries, not a promise that every row can be implemented
without another design decision. Keep syntax proposals out of the runnable playground
until they work. When a row changes source behavior, update the grammar, reference,
editor, executable examples and rejection tests together.

## Reference execution invariants

A step partition must not itself become a source effect. The same selected schedule
must retain effect order, outcome payloads and fault dispositions. Fuel exhaustion
remains a host limit, not a task result or cancellation request.

Only the currently executing context may alter its ordinary local state. A pending
readiness registration owns an explicit continuation, and a wake cannot resume a
completed/retired frame or consume a result twice. Readiness and task completion are
not automatically identical: a resumed control may suspend again or complete with
one of its declared alternatives.

No owner frame retires while a child or escaped result still holds its storage.
Fault handover waits until all affected borrowers have ended. Cancellation requests
do not release loans; actual checked settlement does. Retaining a frame does not
by itself grant permission to access a suspended exclusive borrower’s source.

The first complete async acceptance specimen still needs two overlapping operations,
a borrow held across suspension, cancellation racing normal completion, a visible
cleanup failure, and an escaping child fault. Compare normal and emergency histories
separately. A timer that prints in the expected order is insufficient evidence.

## Native coroutine route

LLVM provides coroutine suspension, resumption and destruction mechanisms and warns
that compatibility across releases is not guaranteed. E2 will pin a toolchain rather
than treating the host Rust compiler's LLVM backend as direct coroutine lowering.
[LLVM coroutine documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/Coroutines.html).

Tellur's design responsibility is to establish when a frame is quiescent and its
children, references and resource obligations are settled before native destruction.
This is a language/runtime requirement, not a cleanup guarantee supplied by an
intrinsic. Keep normal result delivery, cancellation and source-fault settlement as
separate transitions in the checked representation and comparison evidence.
